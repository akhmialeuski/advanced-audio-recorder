# Obsidian Advanced Audio Recorder

A powerful audio recording plugin for Obsidian that enhances your workflow with folder selection, audio source options, pause functionality, and multi-track capabilities.

## Features

- **Audio Source Picker**: Select your preferred microphone or input device directly from the interface.

## Known Limitations

Current version has the following limitations which are being addressed in upcoming updates:
